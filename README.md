# LanguageLab

LanguageLab is a set of web apps for practicing foreign languages and measuring their development. It is still in development.

## Getting started

The project is divided into a backend API, written in Python using FastAPI, and a frontend, written in Svelte. Both are technically independent. To get the project working and running in development, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
